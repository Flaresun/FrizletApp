frizlet-app-frontend.vercel.app

Frizlet App is a Quizlet mock app that authenticates users and allows them to create, get, update, and delete flashcards. Users can also flip through the flashcards they create and study them.
The app was built with Javascript, React, and TailwindCSS frontend. On the backend, I used Nodejs, expressjs and mongodb.
